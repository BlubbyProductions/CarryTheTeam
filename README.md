# Welcome to the CarryTheTeam wiki!


This wiki will contain information about our future game.


This game was inspired by Mario party, a casual mini-game based game that will feature couch-multiplayer and online multiplayer up to 4-players. Everyone in the development team comes up with ideas for mini-games as well as attempting to implement them.


Currently in the development team we have:


FanMan - Project Lead/Physics Programmer

Brotome - Lead Artist

NightyNightSky - Co-lead Artist

Animal - General Game Programmer

Lyganesh - General/Network Programmer
